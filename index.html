              <h2>About Me</h2>
            
              <p>First and foremost, I am a Filipino who moved here in the United States in 2014. I am currently a student who majors in Software Engineering in Brooklyn Technical High School of 2022. I plan to pursue careers involving in this major in college as well. Though I am a beginner, I am willing to learn more to expand and improve my skill set. Outside of school, you can probably see that I am almost always watching shows whether it be anime or a television series, or reading mangas and light novels. Other than this, I am also a swimmer. I swim competitively ever since I was 8 years old. I won some and lost some. But overall, I had a lot of fun whether it be one or the other.</p>

              <h2>Experience as a Swimmer</h2>
            
              <p>As I mentioned, I started swimming when I was 8 years old. It would be a lie if I said that I loved swimming the moment I started. I was "forced" to do so since my 2 oldest sisters became swimmers as well. Due to that, I was expected to follow suit. There were times that I was struggling and really desired to quit. But of course, now, I came to appreciate what my parents did. I was able to meet new life-long friends, and experience the joy of traveling, playing, training, and competing with them. We participated multiple regional competitions and marathons and won numerous medals. And Although there were times I felt down due to the result, they were there for me to support me back up.</p>

              <h2>Interests</h2>
            
              <p>As you may have already guessed (and read), my interests include reading mangas and novels, and watching anime or other shows. I was introduced in this world of entertainment by my oldest sister. Through this shared interests, we were able to get closer to each other, talking and recommending shows. In addition to this, I was able to gain friends through this common interests. Most of the friends I built up still exist today. They also still discuss about it. I am probably never going to lose interest anytime sooner. These mediums fascinates me since it almost always delivers a message implicitly or explicitly. I try to analyze it myself and if I fail to do so, there is a huge community that discusses about these topics. Most of the time these people bring up details that I never even thought of so it is quite amazing. Of course, some shows are jsut for pure relaxation or entertainment, I do not always look for deep messages.</p>
