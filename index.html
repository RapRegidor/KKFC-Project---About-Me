              <h3>About Me</h3>
            
              <p>First and foremost, I am a Filipino who moved here in the United States in 2014. I am currently a student who majors in Software Engineering in Brooklyn Technical High School of 2022. I plan to pursue careers involving in this major in college as well. Though I am a beginner, I am willing to learn more to expand and improve my skill set. Outside of school, you can probably see that I am almsot always watching shows whether it be anime or a television series, or reading mangas and light novels. Other than this, I am also a swimmer. I swim competitively ever since I was 8 years old. I won some and lost some. But overall, I had a lot of fun whether it be one or the other.</p>

              <h3>Brief Experience as a Swimmer</h3>
            
              <p>As I mentioned in the 'About Me' section, I started swimming when I was 8 years old. It would be a lie if I said that I loved swimming the moment I started. I was "forced" to do so since my 2 oldest sisters became swimmers as well. Due to that, I was expected to follow suit. But of course, like most of other events, I came to appreciate what my parents did. I was able to meet new life-long friends, and experience the joy of traveling, playing, training, and competing with them. We participated multiple regional competitions and marathons and won numerous medals. And Although there were times I felt down due to the result, they were there for me to support me back up.</p>
