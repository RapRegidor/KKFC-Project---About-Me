              <p>The best game I ever played. To me, it is a masterpiece. I am very thankful to my friend who let me borrow his library for this game. I couldn't stray away from the game and was completely immersed. I spent a total of 27 hours to complete the good route - 10+ hours each day. I would definitely say it was worth it. The characters are very lovable and their dynamics with each other is very pleasant to watch. At first, it may seem to be a laid-back and just cutesy events. But it will eventually dive deeper to a darker and stronger themes of guilt and escapism (or disassociation which is worse). I definitely didn't cry at the end.</p>

              <p>Oh boy. This is one of the oldest game that I still play today from time to time. I remember back in my country I always play this game on the way to school in the back of the car. I was completely addicted to it. Sadly, I could only play against bots but it was still fun. It is also one of the games that I play with my father. From time to time, we play co-op and run over the hardest bots. Let me add this too: USA airforce team ftw.</p>

              <h1>Patapon 3</h1>
              <p>One of my favorite games in my PSP (Play Station Portable). I just recently started to play this game again since I wasn't able to finish this in the past (I admit that I was quite bad and just did whatever). I haven't played the previous two of this series but I have seen comments that says that this is the best one out of all of them. I hope I can finish this soon.</p>

              <h1>Brawlhalla</h1>
              <p>417 hopurs in but I am still so-so. You can play with your friends, or against other strangers. Easy to play but opponents can be very annoying. People can just spam their heavy attacks. But this is how you can improve by learning how to dodge, and punish them. People, especially my friends, says that its a Smash bootleg. But I never played Smash so I wouldn't know :).</p>

              <h1>Terraria</h1>
              <p>Very addictive game. There is so much to this game and there are even more mods to better your experience. I was forced to buy this game by my friends and I say it was very worth it.</p>

              <h1>Spiritfarer</h1>
              <p>Though I haven't finished playing this game yet. I would still recommend this game. It is a bit grindy, but at the same time, it is calming. It is a game about death and moving on. You accompany each spirit in their journey and see them go later on. Just a warning, it may leave you to tears as many other did.</p>

              <p>Do you want to listen to music AND do something? Do you want to be addicted to clicking circles while on beat? Do you want to hurt your wrist and fingers? Then this is for you. Another addictive game that I spent plenty of hours on.</p>
